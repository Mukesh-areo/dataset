To convert your Python script into an executable (.exe) file and pass arguments to it, you can use PyInstaller, which is a tool that bundles Python applications into stand-alone executables. Here's how you can do it:

Install PyInstaller: If you haven't already installed PyInstaller, you can do so using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pyinstaller
Create a spec file: Create a spec file (e.g., my_script.spec) that specifies how PyInstaller should package your script. You can create a basic spec file using the --onefile and --noconsole options to create a single executable file without a console window. Here's an example spec file for your script (my_script.py):
python
Copy code
# my_script.spec

exe = EXE(pyz,
          a.scripts,
          a.binaries,
          a.zipfiles,
          a.datas,
          name='my_script',
          debug=False,
          strip=False,
          upx=True,
          runtime_tmpdir=None,
          console=False,
          icon=None)
Run PyInstaller: Use PyInstaller to build the executable using the spec file and your Python script. You can also specify any additional options or arguments you want to pass to your script.
bash
Copy code
pyinstaller my_script.spec
Run the executable: After PyInstaller has finished, you will find your executable in the dist directory. You can run it directly, and if you want to pass arguments to it, you can do so from the command line:
bash
Copy code
my_script.exe arg1 arg2
Your Python script should now be converted into an executable that accepts arguments.
